# Predicting-Default-Risk
I worked on this project as Udacity required project of BAND program.

You are a loan officer at a young and small bank (been in operations for two years) that needs to come up with an efficient solution to classify new customers on whether they can be approved for a loan or not.

Step 1: Business and Data Understanding
The key business decisions that need to be made: Identify the list of creditworthy of new loan applicants then approve them?

Step 2: Explore and Cleanup the Data

Step 3. Train your Classification Models
Train the dataset using these models:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Forest Model
- Boosted Tree

Step 4. Writeup
You can find the result in the document Predicting Default Risk.pdf
